#1 grad attack
constant grad = -5, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 5
rand uniform grad = (0,1), (0,2), (-1,0), (-2,0), (-2,2)
rand gaussian grad(mu,std) = (0, 1) # not test in this time(0,2), (2, 2), (-2, 2)

#2 rand action attack
type 1: uniform get rand action
type 2: get a same action in a episode

#3 rand reward attack
type 1: uniform ger reward in possible range
type 2: get a same reward in a episode

each test need following four time test:
all 10 bandits, rand 3 of them are bad
1. 10 bandits run
2. use 7 good of them to run
3. rand choose 7 of them to run
4. use mab algorithm choose 7 of them to run
